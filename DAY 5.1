 1 -> GsapTo
The gsap.to() method is used to animate elements from their current state to a new state.

The gsap.to() method is similar to the gsap.from() method, but the difference is that the gsap.to() method animates elements 
from their current state to a new state, while the gsap.from() method animates elements from a new state to their current state.

•	gsap.to property which accepts an ID which is an identifier (ex #blue-box) then peoperties you want to apply to the element you are targeting.
( we have use Gsap hook (ex  useGSAP) and gsap within react. 
Code –
import{ useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";
import gsap from "gsap";

  const GsapTo = () => {
  // TODO: Implement the gsap.to() method
  // writing code from here
   useGSAP(() => {
      gsap.to('#blue-box', {  // second parameter is to animate.
         x: 250,
         repeat: -1,  // it will repeat itself for infinity..
         yoyo: true, // it will reverse the  animation.
         rotation: 360,
         duration: 2,  // 2 sec
         ease: 'bounce.in',
        })
   }, []);
   
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>GsapTo</h1>

export default GsapTo;


•	The <code element is used to visually represent code or text that should be treated as code. This is useful for showcasing code examples,
displaying variable names, or highlighting specific code snippets within your content.

2 ->  GsapFrom
The gsap.from() method is used to animate elements from a new state to their current state.

The gsap.from() method is similar to the gsap.to() method, but the difference is that the gsap.from() method animates elements 
from a new state to their current state, while the gsap.to() method animates elements from their current state to a new state.

Gsap.from():
Code:-----
import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";
import gsap from "gsap";

const GsapFrom = () => {
  // TODO: Implement the gsap.from() method
  useGSAP(() => {
    gsap.from('#green-box', {
     //  y:250,  // vertical direaction. 
         x:250,  // horizontal direaction. // start from 250 px 
         repeat: -1,
         yoyo: true,
         rotation:360,
         ease:'back.in',


    })
  }, []);

<div className="mt-20">
        <div id="green-box" className="w-20 h-20 bg-green-500 rounded-lg" />
      </div>
